# Bioactive Peptides & Proteases Database

This is a Django-based web application designed to store, manage, and explore data on **bioactive peptides** and their
associated **proteases**. The goal of this project is to provide a robust and extensible platform for researchers and
developers working in the fields of biochemistry, pharmacology, and bioinformatics.

---

## Project Goals

- Build a clean and queryable **relational database** for bioactive peptides.
- Include detailed metadata: sequence, activity, source, references, etc.
- Model relationships with **proteases**.
- Provide a **user-friendly web interface** for search, filtering and data export.
- Support **API endpoints** for programmatic access and data integration.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Django (Python)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** Django templates
- **APIs:** Django REST Framework (planned)
- **Containerization:** Docker (for easy deployment and environment management)
